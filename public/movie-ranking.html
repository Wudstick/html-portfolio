<h1>The best movies according to Abid</h1>

<h2>My top 3 of movies of all time</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Pul Fiction</h3>
<p>Because of sick humour and how Tarantino stylized it</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p> Because of the philosphy and Masculinity</p>
<h3> The Dark Knight</h3>
<p> I think its a great Batman movies with Perfect Villians</p>
